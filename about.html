                <p id="about-p">I am Indi Musallari and I am 21 years old. I was born and raised in the North
                    of Albania in a small
                    town called Shkodra. I have finished an Austrian High School in Shkodra three years ago and I
                    decided to finish my studies in Canada. When I came to Canada I started to study French at UQAM
                    University and I finished my studies at UQAM University last year. Instead of Albanian, that is
                    my
                    mother tongue I can speak English, French and German fluently and I also have knowledge in the
                    Turkish language.
                    Instead of my studies, my passions are fashion design and makeup. My interest in fashion
                    started
                    since I was a little. I always liked to dress up with the latest trends and to combine
                    different
                    designs and colors. Before two years I started to watch makeup tutorials and I opened a
                    personal
                    blog on Instagram to share my interests with my followers. I post pictures on my Instagram
                    every
                    week and I also like to influence my followers with my fashion design and trends. </p>
